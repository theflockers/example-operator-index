# a PR to the modeled catalog repo

# here are a few examples of different approaches to fulfilling this target
# comment out / customize the one that makes the most sense, or use them as examples in defining your own
#
# --- BASIC VENEER ---
#catalog: basic framework
#
# --- SEMVER VENEER ---
#catalog: semver framework
#
#  --- COMPOUND VENEER ---
#  this case is for when a single veneer cannot support the use-case, and automated changes to the generated FBC need to be made before it is complete
#  this example models the need to set the v0.2.1 of the operator with the `olm.deprecated` property, to prevent installation
#

# framework target provides two pieces that are helpful for any veneer approach:  
#  - an OWNERS file to provide default contribution control
#  - an .indexignore file to illustrate how to add content to the FBC contribution which should be 
#    excluded from validation via `opm validate`
